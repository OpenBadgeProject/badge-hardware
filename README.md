# Open Badge Project - Surface Mount Version

This is the Open Badge Project hardware repository.

There are two badge designs in this repo. The surface-mount directory holds the surface mount badge design. The production subdirectory contains the BOM and position data files.

The through-hole directory is for the through hole badge material. There is no BOM or pick and place spreadsheet. There's no reason you couldn't do that, but it was designed for humans to solder.
